# Sentiment Analysis on Harry Potter Hogwart Legacy Review

In this project, I tried to implement RoBERTa model on reviews on Harry Potter: Hogwarts Legacy video game to perform a sentiment analysis. This machine learning model determines whether a review is negative or positive.

The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle which has the following columns:

Index

Playtime: Hours of play at the time of review. 0 means less than 1 hour.

Feedback: Positive/Negative Feedback

Review: The review

I will mainly used the review columns to determine whether to review is negative or positive

#Result

From the confusion matrix below, it can be seen that there are 971 True Postives, 77 True Negatives, 11 False Positives, and 141 False Negatives.

# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Harry-Potter-Hogwart-Legacy-Review

In this project, I tried to implement RoBERTa model on reviews on Harry Potter: Hogwarts Legacy video game to perform a sentiment analysis. This machine learning model determines wheter a review is negative or positive.

The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle which has the following columns:

Index

Playtime: Hours of play at the time of review. 0 means less than 1 hour.

Feedback: Positive/Negative Feedback

Review: The review

I will mainly used the review columns to determine whether to review is negative or positive
